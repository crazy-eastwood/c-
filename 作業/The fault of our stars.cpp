	Augustus Waters drove horrifically.Whether stopping or starting,everything happened with a tremendous JOLT.I flew against the seat belt of his Toyota SUV each time he braked,and my neck snapped backward each time he hit the gas.I might have been nervous-what with sitting in the car of a strange boy on the way to his house,keenly aware that my crap lungs complicate efforts to fend off unwanted advances-nut his driving was so astonishingly poor that I could think of nothing else.
	We'd gone perhaps a mile in jagged silence before Augustus said,"I failed the driving test three times."
	"You don't say ."
	He laughed,nodding."Well,I can't feel pressure in old Prosty,and I can't get the hang of driving left-footed.My doctors say most amputees can drive with no problem,but...yeah.Not me.Anyway,I go in my fourth driving test,and it goes about like this is going."
	A half mile in front of us,a light turned red.Augustus slammed on the brakes,tossing me into the triangular embrace of the seat belt.
	"Sorry.I swear to God I am trying to be gentle.Right,so anyway,at the end of the test,I totally thought I'd failed again,but the instructor was like,'Your driving is unpleasant,but it isn't technically unsafe."
	"I'm not sure I agree,"I said."I suspect Cancer Perk."
	Cancer perks are the little things cancer kids get that regular kids don't:basketballs signed by sports heroes,free passes on late homework,unearned driver's licenses,etc.
    " Yeah,"he said.The light turned green. I braced myself.Augustus slammed the gas.
    "You know they've got hands controls for people who can't use their legs,"I pointed out.
    "Yeah,"he said."Maybe someday."He sighed in a way that made me wonder whether he was confident about the existence of someday.I knew osteosarcoma was highly curable,but stil.
    There are a number of ways to establish someone's approximate survival expectatons withot actually asking.I used the classic:"so,are you in school?"Generally,your parents pull you out of school at some point if thay xpect you to bite it.
    "Yeah,"he said."I'm at North Central.A year behind,though:I'm a sophomore.You?"
